# Synergy between Quantum Circuits and Tensor Networks
This repository is a software implementation of the research paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13673.pdf

The solution comprises of three main parts:
* Training Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network on bars and stripes dataset
* Mapping MPS tensor network to Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC)
* Further extending the PQC using quantum resources

## Deliverables

* Presentation Slides - add path here
* Project Report - 
* Software Implementation
  * MPS training - adapted from pre-existing implementation done by authors of the paper:
    > [**Unsupervised Generative Modeling Using Matrix Product States** by *Zhao-Yu Han, Jun Wang, Heng Fan, Lei Wang, Pan Zhang*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01662)

## Testing 
In order to get an understanding of the project, run the following jupyter notebooks
