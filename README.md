# Synergy between Quantum Circuits and Tensor Networks
This repository is a software implementation of the research paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13673.pdf

The solution comprises of three main parts:
* Training Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network on bars and stripes dataset
* Mapping MPS tensor network to Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC)
* Further extending the PQC using quantum resources

## Deliverables

* Presentation Slides

  * PPTX file: https://github.com/abhishekabhishek/UnsupGenModbyMPS/blob/master/Final_Presentation.pptx
* Project Report - 
* Statement of Contribution - 
* Software Implementation
  * MPS training - adapted from pre-existing implementation done by authors of the paper:
    > [**Unsupervised Generative Modeling Using Matrix Product States** by *Zhao-Yu Han, Jun Wang, Heng Fan, Lei Wang, Pan Zhang*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01662)

## Testing 
In order to get an understanding of the project, run the following jupyter notebook: sandbox/random_near_identity_extended_circuit.ipynb

## Files added
For this project we added the following files:
 
 * random_near_identity_extended_circuit.py - This file has helper methods to create as well as train the fully randomly and near unitary initialized circuits, take results from MPS and convert them into a quantum circuit, extend the quantum circuit created from MPS with SU(4) unitaries, and train the extended quantum circuit.
 * random_and_near_identity_circuit.py - This file has helper methods  to create  quantum circuits extending the initial MPS to unitaries approach and training the extended circuit with SU(4) gates keeping the unitaries generated by MPS fixed.
 * mps_helpers.py - This file has helper functions to assist in the analytic decomposition of an MPS with arbitrary bond dimensions to a parameterized quantum circuit of layers of
two-qubit unitary gates.
 * mps_circuits.py - This file hs Pennylane implementation of quantum circuits constructed using the classically.
 * metrics.py - This file has helper functions to calculate the metrics such as KL-divergence of the models.
 * BStest.b_s_4_3.npy - This file is the data set of 4 x 3 bars and stripes
trained MPS
